Hence the initial value for each page in this example is 0.25. If the only links in the system were from pages B->A, C->A and D->A, each link would transfer 0.25 PageRank to A upon the next iteration, for a total of 0.75 i.e. PR(A) = PR(B) + PR(C) + PR(D). \n",

Page C would transfer all of its existing value, 0.25, to the only page it links to, A. Since D had three outbound links, it would transfer one third of its existing value, or approximately 0.083, to A. At the completion of this iteration, page A will have a PageRank of approximately 0.458.\n",
